## How to Use Alternate Version ##

An alternate version of this patch works only for unsigned versions of GrowlVoice. [You can find those here.](http://www.google.com/search?q=growlvoice+2.0.3+cracked) If main version doesn't work, try this one.

To use, replace `GrowlVoice-helper` and `patch.sh` with the ones in this directory and follow the same steps.
