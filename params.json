{"name":"Fix GrowlVoice!","tagline":"Fix a dying GrowlVoice without requiring manual fancy magic per-launch.","body":"Want to use GrowlVoice without the hassle of manually running a hack each time? Try this!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nIn short, this patch will make app should work just like before.\r\n\r\n- Launch the app by launching the app, just like you used to!\r\n- The \"bad JSON\" popup should never show up in the first place (no unreliable GUI scripting required).\r\n- You can move GrowlVoice app anywhere you want.\r\n\r\n## How to Patch\r\n\r\nPlease backup `GrowlVoice.app` beforehand!\r\n\r\n1. From an admin account, download and `cd` to this repo.\r\n2. `sudo bash patch.sh /path/to/GrowlVoice.app`\r\n3. Open GrowlVoice and enjoy!\r\n\r\nWant this all together? Log into an admin account and:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/szhu/fix-growlvoice.git\r\n    cd fix-growlvoice\r\n    sudo bash patch.sh /path/to/GrowlVoice.app\r\n\r\n(`/path/to/GrowlVoice.app` is `/Applications/GrowlVoice.app` if you leave it out.)\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n- May not work if you have multiple copies of GrowlVoice open. This isn't an additional limitation but a limitation of the cycript hack.\r\n\r\n## Uninstalling\r\n\r\nIn case Google suddenly decides to make GrowlVoice work again\r\n\r\n- Delete `/Library/Application Support/GrowlVoice`\r\n- Delete `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.interestinglythere.fixGrowlVoice.plist`\r\n- Download a fresh copy of GrowlVoice or `sudo bash unpatch.sh /path/to/GrowlVoice.app`\r\n\r\n## How it works & origins\r\n\r\n[@kroo](https://www.github.com/kroo) wrote an [awesome fix for GrowlVoice](https://gist.github.com/kroo/11205755) that uses [cycript](http://www.cycript.org/). However, the hack must be manually run every time you launch GrowlVoice.\r\n\r\nThis is [@szhu](https://www.github.com/szhu)'s automation of that process. It does the following:\r\n\r\n- Installs cycript and the original fix to `/Library/Application Support/GrowlVoice`\r\n- Installs a privileged helper (LaunchDaemon) that runs whenever `/Library/Application Support/GrowlVoice/patch_now` is touched\r\n- Modifies `GrowlVoice.app` to touch `/Library/Application Support/GrowlVoice/patch_now` at the appropriate time during launch\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nI want to know whether this fix works on all kinds of setups. **If this fix doesn't work for you, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/szhu/fix-growlvoice/issues)!** Pull requests are also very welcome.\r\n","google":"UA-48076950-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
